# Catalog Search Capability

* **Capability Name:** `dev.ucp.shopping.catalog.search`

Performs a search against the business's product catalog. Supports free-text
queries, filtering by category and price, and pagination.

## Operation

| Operation | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Search Catalog** | Search for products using provided inputs and filters. |

### Request

{{ extension_schema_fields('catalog_search.json#/$defs/search_request', 'shopping/catalog') }}

### Response

{{ extension_schema_fields('catalog_search.json#/$defs/search_response', 'shopping/catalog') }}

## Search Inputs

A valid search request MUST include at least one of: a `query` string,
one or more `filters`, or an extension-defined input. When `query` is
omitted, the request represents a browse operation — the business returns
products matching the provided filters without text-relevance ranking.
Extensions MAY define additional inputs (e.g., visual similarity,
product references).

Implementations MUST validate that incoming requests contain at least one
recognized input and SHOULD reject empty or invalid requests with an
appropriate error. Implementations define and enforce their own rules for
input presence and content — for example, requiring `query`, rejecting
empty `query` strings, or accepting filter-only requests for category browsing.

## Search Filters

Filter criteria for narrowing search results. Standard filters are defined below;
merchants MAY support additional custom filters via `additionalProperties`.

### Price Filter

{{ schema_fields('types/price_filter', 'shopping/catalog') }}

## Pagination

Cursor-based pagination for list operations. Cursors are opaque strings. A
Business **MAY** encode them as stateless keyset tokens.

### Page Size

The `limit` parameter is a requested page size, not a guaranteed result
count. When `limit` is omitted, the Business **MUST** apply a default page
size. A default of 10 is **RECOMMENDED**, but the Business **MAY** choose
another value.

The Business **MAY** return fewer results than the requested or default page
size, including when enforcing its maximum page size. A Platform **MUST NOT**
assume that the response count equals either value.

### Pagination Request

{{ extension_schema_fields('types/pagination.json#/$defs/request', 'shopping/catalog') }}

### Pagination Response

{{ extension_schema_fields('types/pagination.json#/$defs/response', 'shopping/catalog') }}

## Actions

Search responses adopt the response-only `actions` map. The required `products`
array can be empty; the Business decides whether it contains zero, some, or all
otherwise relevant products under the Action-type contract. See
[Catalog — Actions](index.md#actions) for the parent contract and example, and
[Overview — Actions](../../overview/index.md#actions) for the common rules.
